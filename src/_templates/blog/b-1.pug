								| Understand Business Objectives
					p.p1
						span.s1
							| As with anything, the genesis of every app is an idea. This idea could be driven by a desire to carve out an online presence or to promote your business. Whatever the idea, it’s important to refine and innovate it until it becomes the foundation for an actual app.
					p.p1

								| User Acceptance Testing
